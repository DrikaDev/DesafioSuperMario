    <section class="story">
      <p>"In 1980, Nintendo tried to make a game based on Popeye cartoon, however, Nintendo did not get the copyright from "King Features Syndicate" and had to change its strategy. In order not to lose the game, they asked Shigeru Myamoto to design a new game where he could creat a character based on his own ideas. The result was the Donkey Kong game where a "Jump Man" had to save his girlfriend Pauline from the gorilla. Mario was created to replace Popeye, Pauline took the place of Olivia and Donkey Kong took the role that was from Brutus.</p>

      <p>They decided to gave to this "Jump Man" a huge mustache because they wanted him to look like a human being, and because of this, people realized that the character looked like a Nintendo employee called Mario Segale (actually, Mario Segale was the owner of the building where Nintendo rented in USA). So they had the brillant idea to change the name from "Jump Man" to "Mario" in honor of him.</p>

  <h3 id="curiosity">Mario´s curiosities</h3>
    <section class="curiosity">
      <p>Originally, Marios was a carpinter (in my opinion it was because of those stairs he had to climb in the Donkey Kong game to save Pauline), but after so many pipes he literally had to pass through, he was then consider a plumber. Some of the character details was created to disguise the bad quality of the graphics:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Mario wears a cap because the 8-bit graphics didn't allow him to have well done hair.</li>
        <li>His nose is big to stand out in the small character.</li>
        <li>His big mustache was created to hide the mouth he doesn't have.</li>
        <li>“It's-a me, Mario!” and “Let's-a Go!” are phrases that you can hear in the first game where his voice is given thanks to Charles Martinet who also created the voices for Wario, Luigi and even Donkey Kong!</li>
      </ul>

  <h3 id="luigi">Luigi and friends</h3>
  <p>After the tremendous success in Mario Bros, the character got Luigi, his brother, and in addition, they created a more elaborate story, with well-defined objectives and villains increasing Mario's powers and a lot of friends who got together to save the Princess Peach, captured by the terrible monster Bowser Koppa.</p>
